# Hey there 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
If you want to see my full **Data Analytics portfolio** with all the fancy case studies and write-ups, hop over to my site:

Otherwise, kick back and scroll through — I love digging into data, finding stories hidden in numbers, and building models that actually make sense in the real world.

### Let’s chat!
Always down to talk data, analytics, cool datasets, or just life in general.  
Drop me a message anytime — I don’t bite (unless it’s pizza).
